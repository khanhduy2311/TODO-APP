### e. Service Architecture & Database structure (when used)
**Service Architecture:**
The application follows a **serverless, real-time architecture** using Firebase's Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) model. The React client communicates directly with Firebase services through the Firebase SDK, eliminating the need for custom backend servers while providing enterprise-level scalability and real-time capabilities.

```
Client (React App) ‚Üî Firebase SDK ‚Üî Firebase Services (Auth, Firestore, Real-time Listeners)
```

**Database Structure (Cloud Firestore):**

**Users Collection** (`users/{userId}`):
```javascript
{
  uid: "firebase-user-id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  displayName: "User Display Name",
  friends: ["friend-uid-1", "friend-uid-2"], // Array of friend user IDs
  online: true, // Real-time presence status
  lastSeen: Timestamp // Server timestamp of last activity
}
```

**Todos Collection** (`todos/{todoId}`):
```javascript
{
  uid: "owner-user-id", // Links task to specific user
  text: "Task description",
  dueDate: "2024-12-25", // Due date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  completed: false, // Task completion status
  note: "Detailed task notes and descriptions",
  createdAt: Timestamp // Server timestamp for sorting and analytics
}
```

**Messages Collection** (`messages/{messageId}`):
```javascript
{
  from: "sender-user-id",
  to: "recipient-user-id",
  chatId: "sorted-uid-combination", // Deterministic chat room ID
  text: "Message content",
  participants: ["user1-id", "user2-id"], // For efficient querying
  createdAt: Timestamp // Message ordering and real-time sync
}
```

**Database Indexes:**
- **Todos:** Composite index on `uid` (ascending) + `createdAt` (descending) for efficient user-specific queries
- **Messages:** Composite index on `chatId` (ascending) + `createdAt` (ascending) for real-time chat ordering
- **Users:** Single field indexes on `email` for friend lookup functionality

This architecture supports real-time data synchronization, offline capability, and can scale to support thousands of concurrent users with sub-second latency.
